Tacticool Catgirl Character Reference Sheet	"Someone I look up to was talking about how much he wanted to have an original character. The only details on his mind were tactical/casual wear with bright accents, cat ears, and twintails. After taking a deep dive into his interests and favorite things, I came out with this end result."	"Before making this, I spent a lot of time creating a mood board based on my client's interests, since he didn't know what kind of details he wanted on the character. After finishing the character, my client told me that I know him better than he knows himself. :)"	"Client interaction, Vector graphics, Intense R&D"	Adobe Illustrator	"November 19, 2021"	Client: Mikusch	Digital Graphics & Various Assets	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901206407695728660/919021363497406465/mikusch_resized.png	img	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901206407695728660/919021363497406465/mikusch_resized.png	tacticool
NYCD Special Ops Emblem	"I designed this emblem in coordination with a friend of mine who works at Rikers Island. This was the result of digitally conveying and expanding upon his hand-drawn concept art. It has since been printed and worn on shirts, but it may be seen in badge-form someday."

Kid Helper Character: Marina	"This is a re-imagining of <a href='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/607713698135539736/897377170203234324/Marina_thinnerhead-02.png' target='_blank'>my character, Marina</a>, as a 'kid helper' for a class project. I designed this incarnation of her very carefully, using basic shapes to mold the fine details, so that kids would have an easy time drawing her. She loves fishing and going on adventures in the forest."	"This visual style is mostly inspired by Aggretsuko, as well as most children's cartoons. I could see myself making her move in Adobe Animate if I ever have the time. If I revisited this, I might try and redo the face shape for the side profile."

Font Exhibit Tile: UD Shin Go NT	"For class, I had to research a font, write up a report, and make a design centered around it. Looking overseas, I found a Japanese font that I like, and ended up with this. This aesthetic was jointly inspired by the thumbnails for Morisawa's fonts on the Adobe Fonts website, and the Morisawa logo."	"To give my design an extra bit of exotic flair, I decided to show the font working in its native language. Equipped with an English keyboard and Google Translate, I got to work and came out with the text on the right. I'm told it reads ""fine"". Also, getting a hold of this font was a huge story of its own."

"Silence, Brand"	"This three-pager takes the visual aesthetic of Twitter, and turns its reading hierarchy upside-down. To ensure that I had enough imagery to support the text, I made a collage of famous ""brand moments"". I may have broke some branding rules, especially in handling Twitter's logo. (Sorry, Twitter.)"	"Since my audience when designing this was college students like myself, I decided to slip some humorous and bizarre examples of related imagery into the background, all which directly complement the writing."

Twitch Emoticons	"I've made a wide variety of emoticons for my clients' audience to use in their live chatrooms. Most are based on existing characters, and can be used to express emotion with characters related to whatever game they're streaming. And some are just whatever the client thought would be funny."	"Giving emotion to these characters in such a small space can be difficult. In a 112x112 pixel space that gets further compressed to 28x28 pixels, it was imperative that I made the important details stay visible."

"Unfinished Player Character ""Zane"" Sprite Sheet"	"My brother sent me a still-frame of his character's idle pose. He wanted me to create additional frames, along with other animations. Some features have been temporarily omitted on certain frames, such as lighting/shading, the strap for his backpack, and his tail, all to be added later."	"It can be difficult to redraw characters in new poses. To assist in making sure the body stayed consistent, I started by drawing stick figures that I traced over into the final product.

"Player Character ""Zane"" Movement Demo"	"This is how the sprite sheet for Zane would look in action. While some details are currently missing in some frames, this demo was made to ensure that the locomotion and the user's interaction with it feel good. I slowed down the movement speed slightly so I could showcase it here better."	"Working with such detailed frames can make most animators forget that what matters most is how the movement feels to control. Though this is just a prototype, I made sure not to base the movement controls on the animations, but rather to tailor the animation speed to how I wanted movement to feel."

"Player Character ""Katt"" Retro Sprite Sheet"	"At some point, I was really interested in making a 2D platforming game with the combined aesthetics of the ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64. Also included are particles, effects, and basic level tiles, along with some animated magic platforms that Katt could create."	"On top of working with a limited color palette, I tried to keep my sprites confined to 8x8 tiles, similarly to how old games would need to do that before combining them into one whole sprite due to hardware restrictions. Every pixel was placed by hand, with lots of care going into each frame."

"Player Character ""Katt"" Xmas Alt Sprite Sheet"	I decided that Katt would need a cold-resistant outfit to traverse the snowy area of the game I was making. I drew over the original sprites and added some new ones for a sledding ability. The idea was that each outfit had its own unique ability to help the player overcome obstacles.	"Even though this outfit was more detailed, I still worked in the confines of the original sprites. With details such as the boots going in front of one another, I had to make sure to keep that ambiguity with the same 3-frame leg run cycle. With no other limits, the new sprites were my Manifest Destiny."

Project Katt ZX: Ski Lodge Area	"This ski lodge would have acted as the entrance area to the snowy section of the game. Currently terrorized by radical extreme snowboarders, the employees of the lodge are too scared to fight back. By solving some quick puzzles, Katt can activate the ski lifts and put an end to it."	"This is an actual interactive environment that I set up, so it was incredibly important that I distinguished the foreground from the background. By looking at the four different rooms, it should be obvious to the user what is interactable and what is not."

3D Character: Caleb	"My friend Rey has a character he drew frequently, and for class, I wanted to model it in 3D. He's very fond of old N64 graphics, so I modelled it with Mega Man Legends in mind. If I remade it today, I'd use more textures and less polygons in some spots, with baked-in lighting effects to match the style."	"The major hurdle to overcome was learning the program as a whole. This was the first thing I had ever made in Maya, meaning I had a steep learning curve to go through. It was through the will to learn Maya that I refused to go back to using Blender, which I already knew how to model with."

With three separate characters you could romance, each one has their own musical motifs and instruments."
