This is the repository for my self-coded portfolio website. No bootstrap templates used here!
<br>
After months of on-and-off development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait.
<br><br>
If you are here to check out how my code works, I recommend looking at these files:
<br>
[Link to the Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSsVi4ZkLBQI9OEiEtKEzE9vMGW7Uwu3Wuu60wBgxUAm7uXd16KqCgSLGWwpRbGf6-4YMRpyYLNqjxv/pub) (Data that gets interpreted by the script)
<br>
[Main Gallery JavaScript](main.js) (Generates the gallery and reads the spreadsheet)
<br>
[Main Gallery HTML](/main/index.html) (Has additional JS code for the search functionality)
<br>
[Universal JavaScript](java_half.js) (Code that gets processed on everything but the Home Page)
<br>
[Universal CSS](universal.css) (Styles the pages)
<br>
For more, check out the other files in the directory.

If you see this, send me a message! I'd love to hear from people who have seen my website. Have a good day!
